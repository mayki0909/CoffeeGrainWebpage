# Coffee Grain Studios

In high school, my classmates and I created a group called "Coffee Grain Studios". 
The idea of the group is to publish our projects under this name, regardless of the type of project - web app/design/game/music/video. This way we could connect more, collaborate together on some bigger projects. 
### More importantly, we would help each other and share knowledge with each other.
